# Procedural Map Maker

Created using Unity Engine 2020.3.16, has not been tested on newer versions.

Includes scripts used to generate a map, save it, and some basic UI options. Also includes a working sample scene.

### Options
- 3 Modes: Land/Normal, Island and Lake.
- Seeds and Offset for map variety.
- Octaves, Persistance and Lacunarity parameters for noise.
- Color assignement for different height levels.

### Controls
By default you need UI to change most of the settings, however you can use the arrow keys to move the area covered by the map, R to re-generate the map (done automatically for low map sizes) and G to create a new map with a random seed.

### Map Examples
